# Generate Client Access

When a client is activated, the system automatically generates a **unique access URL** for that client.

## About the Generated URL

- The URL is **unique to each client** and ensures the user lands directly in their own environment.
- This URL is the official link that must be provided to the client for access to their portal.
- It can also be retrieved from the **Client Details** screen at any time while configuring users.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Send the generated URL to the client so they can access their inventory, orders, and information within the system. Do not share one client's URL with another.
{% endhint %}
