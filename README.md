# P4 Warehouse – Client Portal

The P4 Warehouse Client Portal is a web-based platform that allows 3PL clients to manage their inventory, submit orders, and monitor operations in real time — without direct access to P4 Warehouse itself.

The portal is divided into two distinct areas:

| Area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Admin Portal** | Used by the 3PL administrator to manage clients, create users, and generate access links |
| **Client Portal** | Used by each 3PL client to manage their master data, submit purchase orders and pick tickets, and view reports |
