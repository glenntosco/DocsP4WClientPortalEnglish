# Transactional

The **Transactional** module contains all operations that generate real movements within the system. Unlike Master Data, which holds base reference records, this module records what enters, exits, and is processed.

From this module the client can:

- Submit and manage **Purchase Orders** (inbound)
- Submit and manage **Pick Tickets** (outbound)
- Track the status of all orders

| Section | Description |
|---|---|
| [Purchase Orders](purchase-orders.md) | Create inbound orders for stock to be received by the 3PL |
| [Pick Tickets](pick-tickets.md) | Create outbound orders for stock to be picked and dispatched |

---

**Next:** [Purchase Orders](purchase-orders.md)
