# Expiration Report

The Expiration Report displays all products with expiration dates, including:

- Full product details
- Expiration date
- Days remaining until expiration (or days since expiration, if already expired)

This report is used to identify products that are **approaching expiry** or have **already expired**.

## Expired Products

When a product has already passed its expiration date, the system displays a **negative value (–)** in the days column, indicating how many days have elapsed since the product expired.
