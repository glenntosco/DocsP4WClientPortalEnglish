## Creating Products

Products can be created in two ways:

- **Manually** — add each product individually through the interface.
- **By import** — use the system's import template to load multiple products at once.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** Do not modify the column names in the import template. The headers must remain exactly as defined by the system — do not translate them to Spanish or customize them in any way. Any change will prevent the import from completing correctly.
{% endhint %}
