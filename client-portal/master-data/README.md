# Master Data

The **Master Data** module (labeled "Maestros" in the portal) contains the base reference data used throughout the system. This includes:

- [Products](products.md) — all items managed by the client within the 3PL
- [Clients](clients.md) — the client's own customer records
- [Vendors](vendors.md) — supplier information used for purchase orders

Records in each section can be created **manually** or loaded in bulk via **import**.

**Next:** [Products](products.md)
