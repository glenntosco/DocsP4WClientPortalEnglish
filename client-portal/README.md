# Client Portal – Login & Main Menu

## Login

{% hint style="info" %}
From this point on, the user is no longer in the Admin Portal. The Client Portal is a separate environment accessed via the unique URL generated by the administrator.
{% endhint %}

When a client navigates to their generated URL, they access their own **3PL Client Portal** directly.

Users must log in with the **username and password** assigned by the administrator during user setup.

After logging in, the Client Portal displays the following modules in the main menu:

| Module | Description |

| **Master Data** | View and manage base data: products, clients, and vendors |
| **Transactional** | Create and track purchase orders and pick tickets |
| **Reports** | Access inventory and expiration reports |
